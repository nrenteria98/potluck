# The Lore
In 2018, a group of college friends started a Spotify playlist called Musical Potluck. On Mondays, each of them would add 2 songs that they have been jamming to that week to the playlist. At the end of the semester, they got together and had a potluck dinner to discuss their top songs from each person. This potluck of a playlist was meant to expose their musical pallets to a range of different genres all while growing their companionship for each other. Four years later, the group is on their 7th Musical Potluck playlist.

# What is Potluck?
There is one condition that must be met for these playlists. A song cannot be added to a playlist if it has already been added to a previous playlist. It is hard, however, to keep up with hundreds of songs and an inconvenience to go to each individual playlist to search for the existence of a song. Thats where this applicaiton comes in to solve this problem.

This web application is a tool to search for songs that exist across all Musical Potluck playlists. With one simple query, the user can see what added songs have been added with those keywords. If the user searches for a song and receives no listed songs, then the song has not been added to any playlist.
